## Requirements for Smart City Parking Management System

### **Functional Requirements**

1. **Parking Lot Management**
   - Maintain parking lot details (location, capacity, types of parking spots such as regular, disabled, EV charging, and pricing).
   - Monitor and update parking spot statuses (available, occupied, reserved) in real-time.
   - Adjust pricing dynamically based on location, demand, and time of day (e.g., peak hours).

2. **User Management**
   - **Driver Profiles**: Allow user registration with details like license plate numbers and payment methods.
   - **Reservations**:
     - Search and reserve parking spots by location.
     - Provide real-time navigation to reserved parking spots.
   - Define rules for reservations (time limits, penalties for no-shows, and automatic release after expiration).

3. **IoT Parking Spot Monitoring**
   - Simulate IoT sensor integration for real-time updates on parking spot statuses.
   - Implement event-driven updates to notify the database and front-end asynchronously.

4. **Reporting and Analytics**
   - **Admin Reports**: Provide parking lot managers with data on occupancy rates, revenue, and violations.
   - **Global Reports**: Display system-wide insights such as top users and revenue-generating parking lots.

5. **Notifications and Alerts**
   - **User Alerts**: Notify users of confirmations, parking time expiry, and penalties.
   - **Admin Alerts**: Notify managers of over-occupancy, unpaid reservations, or faulty spots.

6. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Implement role-based access:
     - Drivers: Reserve and pay for parking spots.
     - Parking Lot Managers: Manage parking lots and view analytics.
     - System Administrators: Full control over the system.

7. **Transaction Management**
   - Ensure consistency during reservations and payments.
   - Prevent conflicts (e.g., double booking) with concurrency control mechanisms.

8. **Web and API Integration**
   - Provide a web-based interface for users to search, reserve, and navigate parking spots.
   - Develop REST APIs for integration with other applications.

9. **Simulation**
   - Create a Python-based simulator for real-time parking spot updates.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Scalability**
   - Optimize the system for high-volume traffic, supporting thousands of users simultaneously.

2. **Performance**
   - Ensure low latency for queries and updates.
   - Use indexing and database query optimization techniques.

3. **Reliability**
   - Guarantee transaction consistency using mechanisms like ACID compliance.
   - Ensure the system functions seamlessly even under high concurrency.

4. **Security**
   - Protect user data and payment methods.
   - Implement secure authentication and role-based access controls.

5. **Usability**
   - Provide an intuitive user interface for both drivers and administrators.
   - Include features such as real-time updates, navigation, and responsive design.

6. **Maintainability**
   - Use modular and well-documented code for easier updates and debugging.
   - Ensure system logs and error-tracking mechanisms are in place.

7. **Integration**
   - Support seamless integration with third-party systems like city traffic management or IoT hardware.

8. **Availability**
   - Ensure system uptime with minimal downtime for maintenance or updates.
   - Implement backup and recovery strategies to handle failures.

9. **Compliance**
   - Adhere to local regulations for parking management and data handling.
